	<h3>Ka Band</h3>
	<p id="kaband">Ka-band is the next big thing for satellite technology, with smaller terminals and dramatically lower cost. It continues to generate excitement and attract a lot of interest in the satellite industry. Some of its advantages are:</p>
	<ul class="kasolutionlist">
		<li>Since Ka-band frequencies don’t interfere with existing C & Ku satellites, Ka-band satellites can be positioned at existing slots – those now used for C & Ku.</li>
		<li>A large amount of Ka bandwidth is available, which is especially attractive given the limited amount of new orbital slots to support growth in C and Ku-band.</li>
		<li>Ka-band is well suited to utilize small spot beams that allow for frequency reuse.</li>
		<li>Spot beams have the effect of multiplying available capacity and driving down the cost per bit. In addition to this, new High Throughput Satellite (HTS) systems also better enable Ka band to overcome weather issues, as compared to traditional wide beam systems. Spot beams are ‘hotter’ than conventional wide beams which must spread their energy across a wider area, and therefore have a greater ability to cut through weather. HTS systems are also designed to dynamically adjust their characteristics, such as individual beam power, to account for atmospheric conditions in a particular sub-region.</li>
