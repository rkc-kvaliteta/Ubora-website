	<h3>Visitor Management System</h3>
	<p id="vms">The Visitor Management System is developed primarily to address the requirements of automated capture of known travel and ID documents and generate visitor ID in seconds. The System is capable of enrolling visitor’s biometrics in ICAO complain Photos, Finger prints or IRIS images Captured biometrics are instantly transferred to automated Biometric based access control systems and attendance systems. To reduce the complexity with Biometric based verification we have native or web-based verification application which can be done using the encrypted 2D barcodes from any Mobile with suitable camera. 
	The System has robust workflow processing modules for visitor approval, employee approvals and entry, exit, appointment management process. This also supports queue management systems. We can have built custom integration to system where a visitor management system requires to be integrated with. There is an audit trail available for all visitor ID generated. Audit trail is enabled to capture all system-based events and all administrative events. The VMS solution also equip with an easy to use back-end system administration to populate the "user-definable" data entry fields and forms to meet the specific client’s needs and to establish a Platform for Visitors Management System and enterprise wide control over a Security.</p>
